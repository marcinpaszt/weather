Write a program that picks the best day for a picnic, given the least amount of precipitation and a temperature range between 70 to 85 degrees fahrenheit. If there are more than one "best day" provide the answer as a list.

The answer format should be as follows, e.g.,

```
    Monday the 11th day of the month is the best day for a picnic.
```

Afterwards, rewrite your program to take in N days as a parameter, and use the same criteria and answer format to pick the best vacation. Have your program find the greatest number that N can be.
